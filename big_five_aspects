**Understand Myself - The Big Five Aspects Scale**

You have just completed assessing yourself with 100 phrases. Our systems have compared your-self-ratings to those of thousands of other people. You are being compared to men and women of all ages. This means that if you are young, your scores on neuroticism will be higher and on agreeableness and conscientiousness will be lower than if you were compared to people of your own age (with the reverse being true for older individuals). For men, their scores on agreeableness will be higher and on neuroticism will be lower than if they were just being compared to men. We decided to make the comparisons simple, so that you know where you stand in comparison to the typical person (with age and sex regarded as irrelevant).

Here are your results: You will see below where you stand in comparison to others in the general population on the major traits and their aspects:

**Agreeableness**: Compassion and Politeness

**Conscientiousness**: Industriousness and Orderliness

**Extraversion**: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness

**Neuroticism**: Withdrawal and Volatility

**Openness to Experience**: Openness and Intellect

Remember that each personality trait and aspect (and your relative position with respect to them) has advantages and disadvantages. It is for that reason that variation exists in the human population: there is a niche for each personality configuration. Much of what constitutes success in life is therefore the consequence of finding the place in relationships, work and personal commitment that corresponds to your unique personality structure. Good luck with your expanded self-understanding!

Note also that if you find that the descriptions harsher than you might consider appropriate this may mean that you were more self-critical than necessary when completing the questions (remember, the results are based on your own self-report, compared to that of others). This can occur if you were feeling temporarily or chronically unhappy or anxious, or hungry, angry or judgmental when you completed the questions.

### Agreeableness

**Agreeableness: Very Low**

You are very low in agreeableness, which is the primary dimension of Interpersonal interaction in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness, which will be explained separately. Agreeableness is a very complex trait, with marked positive and negative elements all along its distribution. Because of this, higher scores and lower scores need to be explained at the same time.

Your score puts you at the 8th percentile for agreeableness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less agreeable than 91 of them and more agreeable than 8 of them.

People high in agreeableness are nice: compliant, nurturing, kind, naively trusting and conciliatory. However, because of their tendency to avoid conflict, they often dissemble and hide what they think. People low in agreeableness are not so nice: stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical, competitive and, in the extreme, even predatory. However, they tend to be straightforward, even blunt, so you know where they stand.

**Agreeableness**

_8th percentile_

You are less agreeable than 91 of 100 people

People with moderately low levels of agreeableness are seen by others as somewhat competitive, colder and less empathic. They are less likely to look for the best in others, and are not particularly tolerant (an attitude that is much valued by agreeable people). They are less concerned about the emotional state of others, willing to engage in conflict, and will sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point or (if conscientious) to get things done. People find them straightforward, even blunt. They tend towards dominance, rather than submission (particularly if also below average in neuroticism).

People with moderately low levels of agreeableness are not particularly forgiving, accepting, flexible, gentle or patient. They don’t easily feel pity for those who are excluded, punished or defeated. They are also not easily taken advantage of by disagreeable, manipulative or otherwise troublesome people, or by those with criminal or predatory intent. Their skepticism plays a protective role, although it may interfere with their ability to cooperate with or trust others whose intentions are genuinely good. They can appreciate cooperation, but like competition, with its clear losers and winners. They will not easily lose arguments (or avoid discussions) with less agreeable people. They tend to be good at bargaining for themselves, or at negotiating for more recognition or power. They are likely to have higher salaries and to earn more money, in consequence. They are therefore less likely to suffer from resentment or to harbour invisible anger, although this tendency may be increased, if they are very high in neuroticism. In addition, because of their tendency to engage in conflict, when necessary, moderately disagreeable people tend not to sacrifice medium- to long-term stability and function for the sake of short-term peace. This means that problems that should be solved in the present are often solved, and do not accumulate counterproductively across time.

Women are higher in agreeableness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61.5. For men it is 38.5. The fact that men are lower in agreeableness than women helps explain their much higher rates of criminal incarceration (90% male). The primary difference between criminals and non-criminals is disagreeableness. If the typical criminal is more disagreeable than 98% of people in the general population, then almost all those criminals will be male. This difference in agreeableness between men and women is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.

Agreeableness, per se, is not strongly associated with political liberalism or conservatism, but this is because the aspects of agreeableness predict such political belief in opposite ways, and cancel each other out. Liberals are higher in aspect compassion, and conservatives in aspect politeness. However, alliance with the category of belief that has come to be known as politically correct is strongly predicted by agreeableness (particularly compassion). What this appears to mean is that agreeable people strongly identify with those they deem oppressed, seeing them, essentially, as exploited infants, and demonize those they see as oppressors, seeing them as cruel, heartless predators.

There are large differences between men and women in terms of spontaneous interest, and these also appear associated with agreeableness. Agreeable people, caring as they do for others, are more likely to enter professions associated with people, such as teaching and nursing, which are dominated by women. This is true even in the Scandinavian countries, where attempts to produce gender-equal societies has reached a maximum. Disagreeable people, by contrast, appear to prefer systematizing over empathizing, and are more interested in things – machines and technology. In consequence, professions such as engineering and trades associated with construction and machinery tend to be dominated by relatively disagreeable men.

Agreeableness has two aspects: compassion and politeness.

**Compassion: Typical or Average**

You are typical or average in compassion, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the 55th percentile for compassion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more compassionate than 55 of them and less compassionate than 44 of them.

People who are typically compassionate people are reasonably interested in the problems of other people, and other living things. They are somewhat concerned about helping other people avoid negative emotion, but are willing to stand their ground, even when others get upset. They make time and do kind things for other, but balance that with fulfilling their own needs and interests. They have a soft side, but are not pushovers. Other people consider them reasonably sympathetic and nice, and will sometimes turn to them for a listening ear. They can be empathetic and caring. However, they are not primarily other-oriented, so they can negotiate effectively on their own behalf. This helps ensure that they get what they deserve, and shields them from the development of resentment.

**Compassion**

_55th percentile_

You are more compassionate than 55 of 100 people.

Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat higher in compassion than conservatives.

Women are also higher in compassion than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 61. For men it is 39.

**Politeness: Low**

You are low in politeness, which is one aspect of Agreeableness. Your score puts you at the 12th percentile for politeness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less polite than 87 of them and more polite than 12 of them.

People who are low in politeness are not deferential to authority – nor are they obedient. They can be respectful, but only to people who clearly deserve and demand it, and they are markedly willing to push back when challenged. They are not particularly uncomfortable confronting other people. People low in politeness are not motivated to avoid conflict, or to steer clear of conflict or fights. They may find themselves quite frequently in trouble with authority. Their skepticism may make it difficult for them to find a place in the middle or lower in hierarchies of power and dominance. They tend strongly to be dominant, rather than submissive (particularly if they are also low in neuroticism).

**Politeness**

_12th percentile_

You are less polite than 87 of 100 people.

Those who are liberal, politically, score somewhat lower in politeness than conservatives (the opposite pattern is seen with compassion).

Women are higher in politeness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 59. For men it is 41.

---

### Conscientiousness

**Conscientiousness: Very High**

You are very high in conscientiousness, which is the primary dimension of dutiful achievement in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Conscientiousness is a measure of obligation, attention to detail, hard work, persistence, cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes. Conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain order.

Your score puts you at the 91st percentile for conscientiousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more conscientious than 91 of them and less conscientious than 8 of them.

People very high in conscientious people are strikingly dutiful. They tend to be sloggers. They work uncommonly hard and hate wasting time. They are very unlikely to procrastinate (particularly if they are also below average in neuroticism). If a very conscientious person promises to do something, he or she will do it, regardless of circumstances, and without finding excuses. They are uncommonly decisive, neat, organized, future-oriented, and reliable. They are not easily distracted.

**Conscientiousness**

_91st percentile_

You are more conscientious than 91 of 100 people.

Very conscientious people are highly likely to obtain good grades in academic settings (particularly if they are also intelligent), and make extremely very good administrators and managers. They must have have everything in its proper place – which has advantages and disadvantages – and are likely to be over-concerned with detail. They do things by the book. Very conscientious people are also strikingly guilt-prone (although they will organize their lives so they have little to feel guilty about). Very conscientious people are also hyper-susceptible to shame, self-disgust and self-contempt.

Individuals who are very highly conscientious react badly to failure (particularly if they are also high in neuroticism). They are typically judgemental and are disgusted by their own moral transgressions, as well as those of others. They suffer very high levels of shame and guilt when unemployed or otherwise unoccupied, even when that occurs through no fault of their own. Very conscientious people are primarily committed to personal responsibility. They have as an article of faith that those who work hard should and will be rewarded, and that those who don’t work hard and strive deserve their failure. They can be over-concerned with hygiene, moral purity and achievement. They can be micro-managing and controlling.

Very conscientious people are more likely to be political conservatives, rather than liberal (particularly if they are also low in openness).

Women are very slightly more conscientious than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For men it is 49.5.

Conscientiousness has two aspects: industriousness and orderliness.

**Industriousness: High**

You are high in industriousness, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the 82nd percentile for industriousness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more industrious than 82 of them and less industrious than 17 of them.

Highly industrious people are likely to be successful in school and in administrative and managerial positions (particularly if they are intelligent). They value work highly and typically want to be doing something useful. They are dutiful, and tend not to put things off. They do not often mess things up. They always finish what they start, and they do it on schedule. They are frequently figuring out how to accomplish more in less time, with fewer resources. They have focus.

**Industriousness**

_82nd percentile_

You are more industrious than 82 of 100 people.

Highly industrious people are also likely to judge shirkers or people who are incompetent quite harshly, and to want them out of the way. They are likely to believe that people fail because they don’t apply themselves or work hard enough. They feel guilty, rapidly, if they do not do their duty. However, because they typically stay on or ahead of schedule and accept their responsibilities, they rarely experience actual guilt.

Those who are liberal and those who are conservatives appear equally industrious.

Men are slightly more industrious than women. The mean percentile for men in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For women it is 49.5.

**Orderliness: Very High**

You are very high in orderliness, which is one aspect of conscientiousness. Your score puts you at the 93rd percentile for orderliness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more orderly than 93 of them and less orderly than 6 of them.

Very orderly people are highly disgust-sensitive, extraordinarily judgemental, and have a strong tendency towards right-wing authoritarianism (particularly if low in openness).

Very orderly people are uncommonly disturbed and disgusted by mess and chaos. They keep everything neat, tidy and organized. They tend strongly to think in black and white terms: things are good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, with no grey areas. They make and stick to schedules. They like everything exactly where it should be – and very much want to make sure that everything stays where it belongs. They are detail-oriented to a degree that can border on the obsessive. They are strikingly rule-abiding, and insist that rules are scrupulously observed. They require and crave routine and predictability. They can be very good at ensuring that complex sensitive processes are managed properly and carefully.

**Orderliness**

_93rd percentile_

You are more orderly than 93 of 100 people.

Very high orderliness can also constrain creativity (even among those high in openness) as creative endeavors often require mess, disruption and intervening periods of chaos.

Those who are very orderly are remarkably more likely to be political conservatives. Orderliness is the second-best predictor of conservatism, after low openness to experience.

Women are more orderly than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 54.5. For men it is 45.5. This may account for some of the trouble in relation to housework between women and men. Since women are, on average, more orderly, household disorder will trigger disgust and discomfort in them faster. This may happen with sufficient frequency so they end up doing a disproportionate share of such work (even though if they waited a bit longer their less orderly partners, often men, might end up equally troubled and motivated to fix the problem). Orderly people are more likely to have items such as event calendars, drawer organizers, laundry baskets, irons and ironing boards in their immediate environments.

### Extraversion

**Extraversion: Moderately High**

You are moderately high in extraversion, which is the primary dimension of positive emotion in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Extraversion is a measure of general sensitivity to positive emotions such as hope, joy, anticipation and approach, particularly in social situations.

Your score puts you at the 63rd percentile for extraversion. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more extraverted than 63 of them and less extraverted than 36 of them.

People with moderately high levels of extraversion are quite enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social situations, and gregarious. They are often energized by social contact, and crave it. They typically like to plan parties, tell jokes, make people laugh and participate in community activities. They are somewhat more likely to have positive memories of the past, above-average levels of current self-esteem (particularly if they are low in neuroticism), and to feel optimism about the future.

**Extraversion**

_63rd percentile_

You are more extraverted than 63 of 100 people.

People who are moderately extraverted don’t often keep things to themselves, tending instead to share what they are thinking with everyone. They are self-disclosing (particularly if also high in neuroticism) and they warm fairly rapidly to other people. They are among the first to speak in meetings. They can be captivating and convincing. They are likely to be among the first to act in an ambiguous situation.

People who are moderately high in extraversion make more enthusiastic employees, and tend to be well-suited to jobs involving sales, persuasion, work in groups and public speaking (particularly, once again, if they are low in neuroticism). They are somewhat less suited to occupations that require a lot of isolated work (such as computer programming or accounting).

People moderately high in extraversion have a tendency to be impulsive, particularly when it comes to having fun in social situations. They are somewhat more likely to sacrifice the future to the present, when something social or group-oriented beckons. It can be difficult for them to be alone and to study and work. They can find themselves distracted by opportunities to chat, joke and socialize. This is particularly the case if they are also low in conscientiousness. When individuals are extraverted and conscientious, they are more productive than if they are introverted and conscientious. However, when they are introverted and unconscientious, they are more productive than they are when they are extroverted and unconscientious.

People moderately high in extraversion are comparatively more dominant in social situations, particularly if they are also low in agreeableness. Less agreeable extraverts tend to be self-centred – something that can be made worse if they are also low in conscientiousness.

Those who are politically liberal are slightly less extraverted than conservatives.

Women are slightly more extraverted than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 52. For men it is 48.

Extraversion has two aspects: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness.

**Enthusiasm: Moderately Low**

You are moderately low in enthusiasm, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the 30th percentile for enthusiasm. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less enthusiastic than 69 of them and more enthusiastic than 30 of them.

Individuals who are moderately low in enthusiasm are rarely excitable, not particularly easy to get to know, and not known for their talkative nature. When they do talk, it tends only to be about things in which they find particular interest. They do not easily open up to people, particularly in larger social gatherings or parties. They laugh more rarely than others. They tend to prefer solitude, although they can enjoy themselves around other people, in moderation. They are more private people, and are not particularly positive or optimistic. They do not crave the spotlight and, if creative, may find performing less desirable. They rarely seek out stimulation, excitement, activity or fun (and, if they do so, prefer quieter activities). People moderately low in enthusiasm are not gregarious or people-loving, and are not particularly positive about what might happen next .

**Enthusiasm**

_30th percentile_

You are less enthusiastic than 69 of 100 people.

Enthusiasm is not strongly associated with political preference, either conservative or liberal.

Women are higher in enthusiasm than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 55. For men it is 45.

**Assertiveness: High**

You are high in assertiveness, which is one aspect of extraversion. Your score puts you at the 85th percentile for assertiveness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be more assertive than 85 of them and less assertive than 14 of them.

Highly assertive people are “take charge” types. They put their own opinions forward strongly, and tend to dominate and control social situations. Assertive people can be influential and captivating. They have the communication style that is often associated with leadership. This is good when they are knowledgeable, competent and able, but not so good when they aren’t. Assertive people are people of action. They don’t generally wait for others to lead the way. They can be more impulsive than average, and can act without thinking.

**Assertiveness**

_85th percentile_

You are more assertive than 85 of 100 people.

Liberals tend to be slightly less assertive than conservatives.

Women are slightly less assertive than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 48. For men it is 52.

---

### Neuroticism

**Neuroticism: Low**

You are low in neuroticism, which is the primary dimension of negative emotion in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Neuroticism is a measure of general sensitivity to negative emotions such as pain, sadness, irritable or defensive anger, fear and anxiety.

Your score puts you at the 11th percentile for neuroticism. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in neuroticism than 88 of them and higher in neuroticism than 11 of them.

People with low levels of neuroticism rarely focus on the negative elements, anxieties and uncertainties of the past, present and future. It is rare for them to face periods of time where they are unhappy, anxious and irritable, unless facing a serious, sustained problem. Even under the latter conditions, they cope well, don’t worry too much, and recover quickly when stressed. They’re good at keeping their head in a storm, and they seldom make mountains out of molehills.

**Neuroticism**

_11th percentile_

You are lower in neuroticism than 88 of 100 people.

They tend to have much higher levels of self-esteem, particularly when they are also average or above average in extraversion. They are at low risk for developing anxiety disorders and depression (again, particularly if average or above in extraversion).

When good things happen to them, people with low levels of neuroticism can accept it, without questioning whether or not they deserved it. They are usually satisfied with their relationships and careers. Overall, they are tolerant of stress, and can accept failure and setbacks as part of life. Low levels of neuroticism are associated with decreased concern about mental and physical health, much fewer physician and emergency room visits, and reduced absenteeism at work and at school (unless accompanied by very low levels of conscientiousness).

People with low levels of neuroticism can handle risk substantively better, without becoming unduly concerned. They are rarely concerned with security, and can more easily handle recreational, career, financial and social situations where the possibility of loss is higher. They find considering as well as implementing career changes and other transformations that could enhance their lives much less stressful.

Neuroticism is not a powerful predictor of political belief, either conservative or liberal.

Females tend to be higher in neuroticism than males. The typical woman is higher in neuroticism than 60% of the general population of men and women combined. In part, this may be why women report more unhappiness in their relationships, at work, in school and with their health than men, on average, and why women initiate 70% of all divorces. This difference in neuroticism between men and women appears to emerge at puberty. It is largest in countries such as Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological factors rather than environment and learning account for the dissimilarity.

Trait neuroticism is made up of the aspects withdrawal and volatility.

**Withdrawal: Moderately Low**

You are moderately low in withdrawal, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the 23rd percentile for withdrawal. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in withdrawal than 76 of them and higher in withdrawal than 23 of them.

Individuals moderately low in withdrawal tend not to suffer from nor be impeded by anticipatory anxiety. They can handle new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations quite well. They are not more likely to avoid or withdraw in the face of the unknown and unexpected.

People with moderately low levels of withdrawal occasionally feel sad, lonesome, disappointed and grief-stricken, but not too deeply, and not for too long. They experience lower than normal levels of doubt and worry, embarrassment, self-consciousness and discouragement in the face of threat and punishment. They are not particularly sensitive nor worried about social rejection, and don’t easily feel hurt or threatened. Even when hurt, frightened, or anxious, they recover with relative ease and speed. People with moderately low levels of withdrawal are not particularly concerned that something bad is going to happen. Technically, withdrawal has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate passive avoidance.

**Withdrawal**

_23rd percentile_

You are lower in withdrawal than 76 of 100 people.

Those who are liberal, politically, are slightly higher in withdrawal than conservatives.

Women are higher in withdrawal than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 60. For men it is 40.

**Volatility: Very Low**

You are very low in volatility, which is one aspect of neuroticism. Your score puts you at the 7th percentile for volatility. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be less volatile than 92 of them and more volatile than 7 of them.

Individuals very low in volatility are highly stable and predictable in their moods. They are almost never irritable, and feel very little disappointment, frustration, pain and loneliness. People find them easy to be with and can very frequently relax around them. They almost never express their frustration, disappointment and irritability and appear very reasonable when they do so. Even on those infrequent occasions where they become stirred up, upset, angry or irritated, they calm down very quickly. They are not at all argumentative and very rarely lose their composure.

Even if highly provoked in a dispute, a person of very low volatility will rarely react in kind (particularly if also high in agreeableness). Such people remain calm and unperturbed even when highly stressed. Volatile people tend to get upset if something bad does happen, while people high in withdrawal (the other aspect of neuroticism) tend to be concerned that something bad might happen. Technically, volatility has been associated with activity in the brain systems that regulate fight, flight or freeze.

**Volatility**

_7th percentile_

You are less volatile than 92 of 100 people.

Volatility is not strongly related to political preference, either liberal or conservative.

Women are higher in volatility than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 57.5. For men it is 42.5.

Openness to Experience: High
You are high in openness to experience, which is the primary dimension of creativity, artistic interest and intelligence (particularly verbal intelligence) in the Big Five personality trait scientific model. Openness to experience is a measure of interest in novelty, art, literature, abstract thinking, philosophy as well as sensitivity to aesthetic emotions and beauty.

Your score puts you at the 83rd percentile for openness to experience. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in openness to experience than 83 of them and lower in openness to experience than 16 of them.

People with high levels of openness to experience are much more likely than average to be characterized by others as smart, creative, exploratory, intelligent and visionary. They are highly interested in learning, and continually acquire new abilities and skills. They are very curious and exploratory. They find themselves unusually interested in abstract thinking, philosophy, and the meaning of belief systems and ideologies. They will seek out cultural events such as movies, concerts, dance recitals, plays, poetry readings, gallery openings and art shows. They are very likely to enjoy writing (or even to be driven to write). They enjoy complex, abstract ideas and love to confront and solve complex, abstract and multi-dimensional problems.

---

### Openness to Experience

**Openness to Experience**

_83rd percentile_

You are higher in openness to experience than 83 of 100 people.

They are very likely to be prolific readers, with a strikingly wide range of interests. They have an atypically broad and deep vocabulary. They can think and learn very quickly. They are very proficient at formulating new ideas, and tend strongly to be articulate (particularly if average or above in extraversion). People high in openness can see old things in new ways. They can formulate any single problem in a highly diverse range of ways, and can generate a very large number of problem-solving solutions. They seek change, often to make things better, but also just for the sake of change.

People who are high in openness to experience are less well adapted to and tend to do less well in situations or occupations that are routinized and predictable. They do not fit in very well at the bottom of hierarchies. They are typically ill-suited to entry-level, repetitive, rote positions, because they are always thinking up new ways to do things, and such ideas are seldom welcome from someone at the bottom. They are radical thinkers. They shake things up, particularly if they are also disagreeable and assertive. They are somewhat more likely to be revolutionary rebels (particularly if average or below in conscientiousness).

Individuals high in openness to experience tend strongly to be entrepreneurial in spirit, as well as smart and creative. They have much higher than average interest in creating new ventures, sometimes for profit, sometimes for curiosity, and sometimes for personal transformation. High levels of openness to experience appear necessary to the formation and leadership of business and other forms of complex organization, although conscientiousness appears required for the attention to detail and process management that such organizations also always need.

Because people who are high in openness to experience tend to be interested in almost everything, this can make it harder for them to settle on a single path in life, to specialize to a necessary degree, and to create an integrated identity. This problem can be exaggerated if they are high in neuroticism and/or low in conscientiousness. People characterized by the combination of high openness to experience and high neuroticism often undermine their own convictions and beliefs by questioning and making themselves lost and anxious. Open, unconscientious people tend to be “under-achievers” (particularly if also above average in neuroticism). Such people appear to have the capability to succeed, can learn quickly, and are creative, but they can have some trouble implementing their ideas.

Openness to experience is the dimension that best predicts political allegiance (with conscientiousness, particularly the aspect of orderliness, coming in at second place). Those who are liberal, politically, are very much more likely to be high in openness to experience than conservatives.

Women and men differ very little in openness to experience at the trait level, although there are differences in the aspect levels.

Trait openness to experience is made up of the aspects of intellect and openness.

**Intellect: Exceptionally High**

Note: Do not confuse the personality aspect of Intellect with IQ. Intellect is a measure of interest in abstract ideas, essentially, while IQ is a measure of processing speed, verbal ability, working memory, and problem solving capacity, and is better measured with a formal IQ test. It is perfectly possible to have a high IQ and a low score on the personality trait of Intellect (or the reverse).

You are exceptionally high in intellect, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the 97th percentile for intellect. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be higher in intellect than 97 of them and lower in intellect than 2 of them.

People exceptionally high in intellect are obsessed by engaging with ideas and abstract concepts. They require exposure to novel information, particularly when it is complex and sophisticated. They are extremely curious and exploratory, and actively need to find, tackle and solve challenging problems. They will constantly seek out and initiate issue-oriented discussions, and tend to compulsively read, think about and discuss idea-centered books (generally non-fiction). They are notably articulate, and can formulate ideas very clearly and exceptionally quickly (particularly if average or higher in extraversion). They have a much broader and wider vocabulary, and continually require themselves to learn new things. People exceptionally high in intellect will continually find and generate novel, creative concepts and voluntarily search for and adapt exceptionally well to new experience and situations.

**Intellect**

_97th percentile_

You are higher in intellect than 97 of 100 people.

People exceptionally high in intellect find complex, rapidly changing occupations asbolutely necessary and will excel at them (particularly if they are also high in conscientiousness and low in neuroticism). However, they are not at all suited to stable, straightforward and more traditional occupations, where the rules don't change, and will experience continual periods of boredom and intolerable levels of frustration in such positions. They are much more suited to entrepreneurial/creative enterprises (particularly if also high in the openness aspect of Opennes to Experience).

Liberals are higher in intellect than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience at the trait level).

Women are lower than men in intellect (although not in IQ). This is probably a difference in interest: people high in intellect, compared to openness, are more likely to prefer the sciences to the arts. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 45. For men it is 55.

**Openness: Moderately Low**

You are moderately low in openness, which is one aspect of openness to experience. Your score puts you at the 38th percentile for openness. If you were one of 100 people in a room, you would be lower in openness than 61 of them and higher in openness than 38 of them.

The closest synonym for openness (rather than openness to experience, which encompasses openness and intellect) is creativity. People moderately low in openness or creativity do not find beauty particularly important. They tend not to require an outlet for their creative ability, and will certainly not wither away without it. They don’t particularly appreciate art or beautiful crafts, and are less sensitive to color and architectural form. They are not typically collectors, and very rarely pursue it passionately. They are less imaginative, more rarely daydream and reflect less often than average. If they enjoy music or other art forms, their taste tends toward the conventional and popular. They are less often musical or artistic themselves (both of these are rare in the general population). They do not generally become immersed in a book, or a movie, or in their own thoughts.

**Openness**

_38th percentile_

You are lower in openness than 61 of 100 people.

People of moderately low openness tend to be quite stable and conventional (particularly if they are also average or above in conscientiousness). At least moderate levels of openness tend to be necessary for entrepreneurial success, and prove comparatively useful at the top of hierarchies, even in very conservative occupations such as banking, accounting and law, which need creative people in leadership positions to provide new vision and direction.

Liberals are higher in openness than conservatives (although the biggest difference between the two is openness to experience, at the trait level).

Women are higher in openness than men. The mean percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 56.5. For men it is 44.5.
